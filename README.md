FoodByte is a fun Hackathon web application that we made at LA Hacks 2015! Where Tinder meets Yelp, users of FoodByte browse through pictures of meals (at least we tried to...) of various restaurants in the local area. If users like a dish they see, they can select "Yes" and get the restaurant's address and other information; otherwise, FoodByte cycles through other random dishes in the area.
